# Codeup Setup Script

Copy and paste the following in your terminal:

```
bash -c "$(curl -sS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zgulde/codeup-setup-script/master/install.sh)"
```

## Note for Instructors

If students already have and `id_rsa` ssh key generated the script will *not* try to
generate a new ones, and you will need to walk them through the process of adding
their existing key to Github.
